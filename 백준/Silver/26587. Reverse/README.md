<p>At a contest you have been asked to write a program that reads in a line of text and reverses the order of all words that begin with vowels. Words that begin with consonants will keep their position in the line of text. You are not sure why you would ever need this, but hey it’s worth points.</p>

### 입력

### 출력 

 <p>For each input, display the converted line on its own line.</p>
