### 문제 설명

<p>Ada gives John a positive integer $N$. She challenges him to construct a new number (without leading zeros), that is a multiple of $9$, by inserting <i>exactly</i> one digit (<code>0</code> …… <code>9</code>) anywhere in the given number $N$. It is guaranteed that $N$ does not have any leading zeros.</p>

<p>As John prefers smaller numbers, he wants to construct the <i>smallest</i> such number possible. Can you help John?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ test cases follow.</p>

<p>Each test case has a single line containing a positive integer $N$: the number Ada gives John.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing <code>Case #x: y</code>, where $x$ is the test case number (starting from 1) and $y$ is the new number constructed by John. As mentioned earlier, $y$ cannot have leading zeros.</p>
