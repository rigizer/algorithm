### 문제 설명

<p>A drone is being tested by finding the shortest path through a maze, reaching every checkpoint on the way in order. Your task is to write a program that finds the shortest path from the start, through every checkpoint in order, and then to the exit, then prints the length of that path.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line will contain a single integer n that indicates the number of data sets that follow. Each data set will start with three integers r, c, and d representing the number of rows and columns of the maze and the number of checkpoints, respectively. The next r lines will make up the maze, with S being the starting point, E being the end point, the numbers 1-9 being checkpoints, # being a wall, and . being an open space. S and E also count as open spaces.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output will be the length of the shortest path from the start, through every checkpoint in order, and to the exit. There will be n lines of output with no trailing whitespace.</p>
