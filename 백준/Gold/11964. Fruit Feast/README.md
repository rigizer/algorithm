### 문제 설명

<p>Bessie has broken into Farmer John's house again! She has discovered a pile of lemons and a pile of oranges in the kitchen (effectively an unlimited number of each), and she is determined to eat as much as possible.</p>

<p>Bessie has a maximum fullness of \(T\) (\(1 \le T \le 5,000,000\)). Eating an orange increases her fullness by \(A\), and eating a lemon increases her fullness by \(B\) (\(1 \le A, B \le T\)). Additionally, if she wants, Bessie can drink water at most one time, which will instantly decrease her fullness by half (and will round down).</p>

<p>Help Bessie determine the maximum fullness she can achieve!</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first (and only) line has three integers \(T\), \(A\), and \(B\).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>A single integer, representing the maximum fullness Bessie can achieve.</p>
